    "Now you can use the validation set (NOT the test set) to finetune the hyperparameters and see how far you can go. According to [this benchmark](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cifar-10), the current models dominating the leaderboard on vision data are vision transformers (ViT), [introduced here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf). You could also try to implement this, but you also see that some CNNs are achieving more than 80% accuracy, which is already really good. Some tricks to perform better consist in adding dropout, momentum, learning rate scheduling, in addition to careful hyperparameter tuning."
